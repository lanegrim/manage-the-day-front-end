# manage-the-day-front-end
Manage the Day is a collaborative taks/project-management app, seeking to mimic the features of popular platforms like Trello.

## Technologies Used
## Back End
- Python
- Flask + SQLAlchemy
- PostgreSQL
- Firebase

## Front End
- HTML
- CSS + Bootstrap
- React
- React-Bootstrap
- React-beautiful-dnd

## Approach and Take-Aways
At its core, this app was meant, and continues to be, an exercise in working with multiple layers of data and frequent communication between a highly-interactive front end and multiple back ends. I entered the development of this app seeking to continue to gain experience working with Python and its frameworks (Flask, in this case) in the back end, while deepening my understanding of React and the many approaches and tools it offers.

## Opportunities for Future Improvement and Expansion
- I am currently working on implementing nested drag-and-drop contexts using React-dnd-beautiful and hope this will be fully deployed soon
- Smoother interaction between the front and back end (app produces non-crash errors because of missing url params sometimes)
- A more elegant solution for collaborators / live updates when changes are made by collaborators
- Currently, all boards sent to the front end, but only relevant boards are rendered. This produces a security concern and will be handled in the back end in the future
- Improved styling
