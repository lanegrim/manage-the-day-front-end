# manage-the-day-front-end
Manage the Day is a collaborative taks/project-management app, seeking to mimic the features of popular platforms like Trello.

## Technologies Used
## Back End
- Python
- Flask + SQLAlchemy
- PostgreSQL
- Firebase

## Front End
- HTML
- CSS
- React + JSX
- React-Bootstrap

## Approach and Take-Aways
At its core, this app was meant, and continues to be, an exercise in working with multiple layers of data and frequent communication between a highly-interactive front end and multiple back ends. I entered the development of this app seeking to continue to gain experience working with Python and its frameworks (Flask, in this case) in the back end, while deepening my understanding of React and the many approaches and tools it offers.

## Opportunities for Future Improvement and Expansion
- I am currently working on implementing nested drag-and-drop contexts using React-dnd-beautiful and hope this will be deployed soon
- Smoother interaction between the front and back end when adding/deleting/moving columns within a board (currently working to automate the function currently executed by the "Save Board Configuration" button)
- Improved styling
